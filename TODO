TODO exclude users by group
TODO make static frontpage lastmod sync to last publication date optional

CONSIDER:
 - allow inclusion of empty tax archives
 - optionally calculate lastmod for first page sitemap and homepage when blogpage by either last post modified date or by last post date (core vs. plugin)
 - Maybe add dedicated Media sitemap if image tags are (still) not possible OR completely replace the renderer?
 - Add custom post type root pages?
	Maybe with wp_sitemaps_posts_pre_url_list (replacing the whole posts provider url_list)
	With $post_type_archive_url = get_post_type_archive_link( $post_type )
	And then if ( $post_type_archive_url ) { $url_list[] = array( 'loc' => $post_type_archive_url ); }.

TEST:
 - does tax term lastmod ever change after being set as metadata? if not: clear specific metadata on post publication...
